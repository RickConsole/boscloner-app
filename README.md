# BosCloner
Updated + Improved app for BosCloner

This is using the v1.1 version of BosCloner that supports modern BLE hardware. 

## Improvements
To make the cloner more compatible with other cloning tools, the history page has been modified to now display the facility code and card number when a scan is clicked.
